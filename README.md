## Description

This app features a main page which prompts the user to login via their 500px account.  Once successfully logged in, using OAuth 1.0 to authorize a user using their [500px](https://www.500px.com) account, the user is able to view the gallery of the top 100 most popular photographs featured on that platform.  While viewing the gallery of popular photographs, the user can move their mouse over a photo to see two buttons which appear.  One will allow the user to cast their vote (or 'favorite') a photograph if they like it.  The second will allow them to unfavorite the photograph.
